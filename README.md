# DNA-Strand-Simulation

A randomized simulation of large DNA/RNA strands, from which statistics are computed and reported regarding the composition of the strand.

The statistics are primarily an analysis of the proportions of nitrogen bases, codons, and amino acids present within the strand. The program assumes a uniform probability for each base in the strand, but this can easily be changed in the strand.cpp file.
